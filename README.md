## WP Super Cache Plugins

Current plugins:

- HTML Minification
- Move all JS to bottom

### Installation

Upload the folder ``wp-super-cache-plugins`` to ``wp-content/plugins/`` and enable desired plugins on WP Super Cache Options. That is all!

### Others

Also, I recommend use the plugin https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-webfont-optimizer/ if you are using Google Fonts.
